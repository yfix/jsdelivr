description = "The experience and subtlety of your program's text can be important. MessageFormat (PluralFormat + SelectFormat) is a mechanism for handling both pluralization and gender in your applications. It can also lead to much better translations, as it was built by ICU to help solve those two problems for all known CLDR languages - likely all the ones you care about."
